# Search in Graphs

Recall the pseudocode for Depth-First Search:

Given a graph, a start node, and a node we're looking for:
- starting at the start node, while unvisited nodes remain
    - if current vertex $v$ is the node we're looking for, return it
    - mark $v$ as visited
    - for each edge $(v,w)$
        - recursively process $w$ unless marked visited

Implement the algorithm. You can choose any of the data structures we covered
(adjacency matrix or adjacency list) for the implementation. Your function
should return the list of nodes on the path from the start to the target (not
the list of nodes that you looked at during the search). If start and target are
the same, it should return a list with only that node. If there is no parth from
the start to the target, it should return an empty list. Start with the template
I provided in `code.js` and test your new function.

I have not provided any test code, but you can base yours on test code from
other exercises. Your tests must check the correctness of the result of running
the function and run automatically when you commit through a GitHub action.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the worst-case big $\Theta$ complexity of your implementation? Add your
answer, including your reasoning, to this markdown file.

## My Analysis

My worst case complexity would be $\theta(E+V)$ where $E$ is the number of edges and $V$ is the number of vertices. This is because my algorithm will try to check every single node and all of the ones connected to it.

## Bonus

Implement and analyze breadth-first search.

I coded my algorithm with the help of the pseudo code and also used chatgpt to help me debug

looked at https://github.com/COSC3020/graph-search-ZachRenz to see how he had his tests formatted.
